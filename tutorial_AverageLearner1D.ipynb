    "The behavior of the AverageLearner1D is governed by several parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `loss_per_interval`: loss function (same as in the Learner1D). In our example we use the triangle loss.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    " - `delta`: __this parameter is the most relevant and controls the resampling condition__. A point $x_i$ is resampled if $\\Delta g_i > $ `delta` $\\cdot\\min(d_i,d_{i+1})$, where $d_i = \\sqrt{(x_{i+1}-x_i)^2 + (y_{i+1}-y_i)^2}$ and $\\Delta g_i$ is the uncertainty in the estimate of the mean at $x_i$. Large values of `delta` favor the \"exploration\" behavior, although this can make the learner to sample noise (in any case, we strongly recommend `delta` $\\leq1$).\n",
    "On the contrary, small values favor an \"exploitation\" behavior, leading the learner to thoroughly resample existing points. In the documentation, we give bounds for the optimal value of `delta`. In general, the optimal value is around `delta` $\\sim 0.1-0.5$, which we will use in our example.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    " - `alpha`: the uncertainty of each point ($\\Delta g_i$) is estimated as half of the size of the $P\\%$ interval of confidence on the estimate of the mean, where $P=(1-2\\cdot$ `alpha` $)\\cdot100$. The recommended values for `alpha` are $2.5\\%-0.05\\%$. We generally employ `alpha` $=0.5\\%$.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    " - `neighbor_sampling`: each new point is actually sampled $n_\\text{new}=\\max($ `min_samples` , `neighbor_sampling`$\\cdot n_\\text{neigh})$ times, where $n_\\text{neigh}$ is the average number of samples of the two neighboring points. Moreover, we strongly recommend `neighbor_sampling` $\\in [0,1]$ to avoid oversampling (values close to 1, e.g. above 0.7, can also lead to oversampling at some points). In this example we use `neighbor_sampling` $=0.5$.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    " - `min_samples`: minimum number of times that each new point is initially sampled. This parameter is important to prevent the learner from sampling noise in case we accidentally set a too large value of `delta`. However, one must keep in mind that using an excessively large value for `min_samples` can harm the efficiency of the learner. If we estimate that we will require more than a thousand samples per point, we could set `min_samples` $=500$. \n",
    "In our example, we are not sure how many samples per point we will need, so we choose a safe value: `min_samples` $=50$.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    " - `max_samples`: maximum number of samples at each point. If a point has been sampled `max_samples` times, it will never be sampled again. In case we set a too small `delta`, this prevents the \"exploitation\" to drastically dominate over the \"exploration\" behavior. We will use `max_samples` $=3000$ in our example.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    " - `min_Delta_g`: minimum uncertainty at each point. If $\\Delta g_i<$ `min_Delta_g`, $x_i$ will not be sampled again. This parameter has the same goal as `max_samples`: in case we set a too small `delta`, it prevents the \"exploitation\" to drastically dominate over the \"exploration\" behavior. In our example, we do not require any precision beyond $10^{-3}$, so we choose `min_Delta_g` $=10^{-3}$.\n",
